# COSC_499_DEMO
Just a demo to show I am using GitHub. Therefore I am building a simple java program that runs two sorting algorithms and compares there run time.

## Main Function
The Main function runs the program. It instantiates a sorter from which the two sorting algorithms can be run. It also initializes an array with 15 random numbers to sort. Afterwards the two sorting algorithms are run on the array and the time it takes to sort is taken in milliseconds and printed out afterwards. (As here only functions get called I have not implemented any test cases)
